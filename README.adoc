= mew

mew is going to be a next‐generation free software build system.
It aims to combine some of the best attributes of
https://bazel.build/[Bazel], https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix], and
https://shakebuild.com/[Shake]
while being portable to a wide variety of operating systems
and not depending on a large runtime environment like Java.

Right now it's not much of anything, as you can see. But there is a
link:doc/bibliography.adoc[very incomplete bibliography] of sorts,
and some link:doc/notes.adoc[development notes].
