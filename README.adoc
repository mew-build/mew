*mew* is going to be a cross‐platform free software build system.
It aims to combine some of the best attributes of
https://bazel.build/[Bazel], https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix], and
https://shakebuild.com/[Shake],
while distinguishing itself from them
by having a design that integrates better with existing tooling,
working on a wide variety of operating systems
without the need for compatibility layers like Cygwin,
and involving a lot less in the way of Bash and Java.

Right now it’s in early development, and is not really much of anything.
But there is a <<bibliography#,very incomplete bibliography>> of sorts,
and some <<notes#,development notes>>.

If it one day grows to include a package manager,
configuration management system, service supervisor,
and Linux distribution, don’t say we didn’t warn you.
